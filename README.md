# Mathom House

An app to collect up events (or Mathoms) and summarise and visualise them.

I am bad at recognising my own achievements. My hope is that collecting data about my life with this app and
surfacing them in visualisations and analytics will help me to reflect positively on things I've done.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## App structure

This app is a *modular monolith*. At this time, there are three modules planned:
* Auth
* Mathom management
* Analysis

## Deployment

TBC.
